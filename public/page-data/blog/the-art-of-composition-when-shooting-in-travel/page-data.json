For action shots, blurring the background can be achieved by moving the camera at the same speed as the subject while taking the picture (panning).When taking pictures of details such as statues, try where you can to hint at the location as well letting the surrounding landscape be part of the picture. </p> <p> Everyone would like to take good photos in travelling. No matter of how good they are, people will benefit from a change of pace. The best way to achieve this is to ensure each of your photo has details and closeups that bring a different focus to your work. Lighting is important in all portraiture.The best-lit shots are achieved with side-lighting as this emphasises depth and character in the face. The objective is to add just a little light and a glint to the eye; always focus on the eyes as they are the 'Window to the Soul'. When photographing crowds of people it is important to retain a centre of interest. This can be aided by isolating a single ﬁgure or group ofﬁgures, something that can be achieved by a shallow depth of ﬁeld or by motion blur. Look out for details, whether of the everyday variety such as ﬁsh at a market, or artistic, such as tiles and calligraphy. Details help to give a sense of place and they are an important part of telling the story. </p> <p> The best time to take pictures is in the so-called sweet light of the late afternoon or earl morning. The warm, raking light brings out the colours, and shadows are important because they enhance texture and bring contrast of tone. When taking pictures of mountains, try to ﬁnd a viewpoint that conveys a sense of scale and depth for example by having objects in the foreground. Dusk, when there is still some natural light as well as artiﬁcial lighting, is a good time to photograph cities. A hint of blue in the sky will communicate the night-time feel much better than when the sky is black. </p>"},"allDataJson":{"nodes":[{"title":"Why you shold use photo editing service","date":"January 23, 2023"},{"title":"The art of composition when shooting in travel","date":"July 10, 2023"},{"title":"Improve your photography skills in holidays","date":"May 7, 2023"},{"title":"Photo editing services for photographers","date":"July 12, 2023"},{"title":"Product photo editing services help increasing sales","date":"July 10, 2023"},{"title":"wedding photo editing services","date":"March 1, 2023"},{"title":"Using photo retouching software to deliver a successful result","date":"June 7, 2023"},{"title":"Online photo editing solutions for photographers","date":"June 15, 2023"},{"title":"All You Need to Know About photo enhancement","date":"July 13, 2023"}]}},"pageContext":{"title":"The art of composition when shooting in travel"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1343345646"],"slicesMap":{}}
